A summer reading group for Foundations of Data Science ([download link](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf)).

**Guidelines**

Every two weeks we will cover 40 pages. You can always post questions and have discussion on reddit (r/summerds) or slack, but to be considered an *active participant* you will need to complete the following:

- Submit 10 questions related to the reading.
- Answer 2 questions that were posted for the last session.

Both of these tasks should be complete by the end of the session. Both your questions and answers will be posted publically and need to be unique. As you can post them at any time after the session begins, it is advantageous to post them early since you may have collisions with other participants. More than one person may answer the same question as long as the answers are reasonably distinct.

There will be in-person discussion at least once a session. In order to join, you must have been an active participant in the ongoing or previous session.


**Online Forum and Discussion**

The primary source for new announcement and online discussion will be hosted on [zulip](https://summerds.zulipchat.com/).

There's also a dedicated [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/summerds/) for discussion that is better suited for a forum-like format.
